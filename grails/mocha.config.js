// Tests are placed alongside files under test.
// This file does the following:
// 1. Sets the environment to 'test' so that
//    dev-specific babel config in .babelrc doesn't run.
// 2. Disables Webpack-specific features that Mocha doesn't understand.

// This assures the .babelrc dev config (which includes
// hot module reloading code) doesn't apply for tests.
process.env.NODE_ENV = 'test';

// Disable webpack-specific features for tests since
// Mocha doesn't know what to do with them.
